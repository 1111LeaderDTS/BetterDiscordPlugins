# BetterDiscordPlugins


## If you need any help or have any suggestions, feel free to message me, Metalloriff#2891.

## If you would rather [join my Discord server](https://discord.gg/GyPaSWB), or just want to, feel free to. Please keep in mind that it's not specifically a support server for my plugins, but I will provide help and take suggestions there.


## [User Avatar And Server Icon Viewer](https://github.com/Metalloriff/BetterDiscordPlugins/blob/master/AvatarIconViewer.plugin.js)
- Allows you to view server icons, user avatars, and emotes in fullscreen via the context menu. You may also directly copy the image URL or open the URL externally.

## [Voice Chat Mute Sounds](https://github.com/Metalloriff/BetterDiscordPlugins/blob/master/VCMuteSounds.plugin.js)

## [Discord Logger](https://github.com/Metalloriff/BetterDiscordPlugins/blob/master/DiscordLogger.plugin.js)

You can also record servers and it will log users leaving and joining, user nickname changes, role additions, removals, and changes, and channel additions, removals, and changes upon clicking into the server.

```diff
-WARNING: I've abandoned this plugin for many reasons (too broken), and it is being remade as two separate plugins.
One of them is already made, Guild And Friend Removal Alerts, and the other is still a work in progress.
You can still use this terribly broken plugin if you wish, but it will never be updated.
```

## [User Birthdays](https://github.com/Metalloriff/BetterDiscordPlugins/blob/master/UserBirthdays.plugin.js)

## [The Clap Best Clap Plugin Clap Ever](https://github.com/Metalloriff/BetterDiscordPlugins/blob/master/TheClapBestClapPluginClapEver.plugin.js)
- Literally the most useless plugin ever. Put "clapclap:" at the first of your message to replace spaces with clap emojis. You can also do "clapclap(some_emote_name):" to use custom emotes, "ra:" to replace all characters with regional indicators, and "reverse:" to reverse the message.

## [Mention Aliases](https://github.com/Metalloriff/BetterDiscordPlugins/blob/master/MentionAliases.plugin.js)
- Allows you to set an alias for users that you can @mention them with. You also have the choice to display their alias next to their name. A use example is setting your friends' aliases as their first names. Only replaces the alias with the mention if the user is in the server you mention them in. You can also do @owner to mention the owner of a guild.
